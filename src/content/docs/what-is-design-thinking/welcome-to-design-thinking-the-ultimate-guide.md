## Design Thinking Is Not a Toolkit—It’s a Mindset

Design thinking is fundamentally **a way of thinking**, not a rigid process or a checklist of tools. As emphasized by thought leaders like **Arne van Oosterom**, **Tim Brown**, and **Don Norman**, it is about:

- Questioning assumptions
- Challenging existing norms
- Focusing on real human needs
- Encouraging creativity and imagination

It moves beyond mindless execution and solution-jumping. Instead, it demands curiosity, critical thinking, and empathy.

## Why Design Thinking Matters

Design thinking has become powerful because it:

- Breaks traditional silos between specialists
- Encourages multidisciplinary collaboration
- Helps teams solve complex, real-world problems
- Enables disruptive and innovative outcomes

Rather than relying only on experts or predefined strategies, design thinking invites **teams to co-create solutions**—often reinventing products, services, or entire systems in unexpected ways.

## The Five Core Stages (But Not Linear)

Although the course introduces design thinking in a structured way, the process itself is **non-linear and flexible**.

The five core stages are:

1. **Empathize** – Understand users and their needs
2. **Define** – Clarify the core problem
3. **Ideate** – Generate creative solutions
4. **Prototype** – Build tangible representations
5. **Test** – Validate and refine ideas

In practice, teams may revisit stages, overlap them, or adjust the sequence. Design thinking adapts to the project—not the other way around.

## What You’ll Learn in the Course

The course covers:

- The history and foundations of design thinking
- Why it’s more effective than traditional innovation models
- Different design thinking frameworks
- When and where it works best
- How to facilitate it inside organizations

You’ll also gain access to:

- Practical templates
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Hands-on exercises to apply the methods

The emphasis is on **learning by doing**, not just theory.

## Build Your Portfolio: The Practical Project

Throughout the course, you can complete an optional project:

**Design a fitness smartphone app** for people who want to exercise more but struggle to stay consistent.

Each lesson includes one exercise tied to a stage of the design thinking process. By completing them, you’ll:

- Apply real methods
- Practice structured problem-solving
- Create a full UX case study
- Strengthen your portfolio

While optional, these exercises are highly recommended—especially if you’re pursuing a UX career.

## Collaboration and Community

Design thinking thrives on:

- Discussion
- Feedback
- Shared learning
- Diverse perspectives

You’re encouraged to engage with peers, share your work, and refine your ideas collaboratively. Innovation improves when it becomes social.

## Key Takeaways

- Design thinking is a **mindset**, not a rigid formula.
- It centers on **human needs and empathy**.
- It promotes **creative, disruptive problem-solving**.
- The process is **flexible and iterative**.
- Practical application and documentation are essential—especially for building a strong UX portfolio.

In short, design thinking empowers individuals and teams to question, explore, prototype, test, and ultimately create meaningful impact.
